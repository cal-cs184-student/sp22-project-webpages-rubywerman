<h2 style="font-family:verdana,serif" align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana,serif">In project 3-1, we implemented a ray tracing algorithm to create a physics-based
    renderer of scenes with light. For part 1, we implemented ray generation and measuring intersections of triangles
    and spheres. We struggled for a little while getting rays to intersect triangle objects. Eventually, we found the
    bug in our triangle.cpp file that was preventing the ray from accurately intersecting the triangle object. For part
    2, we implemented the BVH acceleration structure used to speed up render times. We got most of the renders to speed
    up the first try, but meshes with large bounding boxes with small objects inside were segfaulting. We fixed this by
    placing the bottom-leftmost primitive was placed in the left node, and the top-rightmost was placed in the right
    node. This ensured that we did not have infinite recursion. In part 3, we implemented direct illumination to light
    up objects appropriately with respect to a certain light source. One thing we struggled with for part 3 was that we
    had a bug in part 2, and it was affecting our renders in part 3. We tried debugging part 3 a lot, but then realized
    that the bug lied within our part 2 code. In part 4, we implemented global illumination which enables the light to
    bounce off of objects and illuminate other parts of the render that could not be illuminated using direct
    illumination. We struggled with part 4 for a while because we had a couple of small bugs, including initializing the
    direction of the new ray in the incorrect direction. For a while, we did not have an illuminated ceiling in any of
    our renders. For part 5, we implemented adaptive sampling which allows renders to render faster because we use a
    lower sampling rate for pixels that converge faster. We had an issue in part 4 that renders were just really dark.
    This caused issues in part 5 where we are not getting middle rate sampling regions.

<h2 style="font-family:verdana,serif" align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana,serif">In our ray generation algorithm, we started by generating the ray in camera space.
    We did this by transforming the
    coordinates we received into the camera space and then transforming it into a ray in world space. We also made sure
    to update the min_t and max_t of this ray to nClip and fClip. For our raytrace_pixel function, we created a for loop
    over num_samples and generated a random point sample in each iteration. We then created a ray off that sample data
    and called est_radiance_global_illumination on that ray. We then took the average of these rays and updated the
    value of the pixel in the sample buffer.
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana,serif">We implemented the Moller-Trumbore algorithm for ray-triangle intersection. First,
    we calculated two edges of the
    triangle. We then created a vector that was the result of the cross product of an edge and the direction of the ray.
    Then we took the determinant by calculating the dot product of that vector and the other edge of the triangle. If
    the determinant is 0, then we know the ray is parallel to the triangle plane and will not intersect. Next, we
    computed u and rejected the triangle if u is less than 0 or greater than 1. U is calculated by taking the dot
    product of the first vector and a new vector that represents the distance from the ray's origin to p1 on the
    triangle and multiplying the product by the inverse determinant. Next, we created a new vector that was the cross
    product of the previous vector and the other edge of the triangle. We computed v (the dot product of the ray's
    direction and vector multiplied by the inverse determinant) and checked that v was greater than 0 and u + v was
    greater than 1. Finally, we calculated t by taking the dot product of this third vector and the first triangle edge
    and multiplying it by the inverse determinant. We checked that t was between the ray's min_t and max_t values and
    then set the isect values.

<h2 style="font-family:verdana,serif" align="middle">Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy
</h2>

<p style="font-family:verdana,serif">We constructed a node and allocated it to heap memory so that it would persist
    through the recursive calls. We
    iterated through all of the primitives passed in, and if it had <= the max leaf node number, we returned the node as
    a leaf node with non-null start and end values. If the node is not a leaf node, we split the area in half by
    determining the longest axis, and then finding the median centroid of all of the shapes by using the centroids of
    each individual primitive. To ensure that none of the nodes would be empty and to avoid infinite recursive calls, we
    found the bottom-leftmost node and always put it in the left child, and the top-rightmost node and always put it in
    the right child. Once the left and right primitive lists have been constructed and allocated to memory, we made 2
    recursive calls to the construct_bvh function: one for the left child and one for the right child.

<p style="font-family:verdana,serif">For maxplanck.dae, the render time with BVH acceleration was 0.2197s. Without BVH
    acceleration it was 115.8828s. For
    peter.dae, the render time with BVH acceleration was 75.3027s Without BVH acceleration it was 0.1519s. The reason it
    is so much faster with BVH acceleration is that we don't have to do ray-intersection tests with every object.
    Instead, we have constructed a tree structure that we can traverse to prune away branches that do not contain
    objects the ray would never intersect.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana,serif" align="middle">Part 3: Direct Illumination
</h2>

<p style="font-family:verdana,serif">We started by implementing direct lighting with uniform hemisphere sampling. For
    `n_samples` times, we'll sample a
    random unit vector in the object space hemisphere, `wi`. Next, we'll convert `wi` into world space using the `o2w`
    matrix; let's call this new vector `wi_world`. Then, we'll create a new ray from the origin `hit_p` and the
    direction of `wi_world`. We'll also add a small epsilon constant to the origin of our ray to avoid precision issues.
    This epsilon value will also be the ray's `min_t` value. Next, we'll calculate the reflectance of our intersection
    object by using `isect.bsdf`'s `sample_f` function. We'll check if our new ray intersects our bounding volume
    hierarchy, and if so, we'll calculate the amount of outgoing light and add it to `L_out`. We get the amount of
    outgoing light for each sample by multiplying the reflected emission along the ray (`isect.bsdf->get_emmision()`)
    with the reflectance and dividing by the pdf. Finally, we'll divide `L_out` by the number of samples and return.
    Essentially, this process is approximating the amount of light arriving in a hemisphere around the point of
    interest, `hit_p` using a Monte Carlo estimator.

<center style="font-family:verdana,serif">Importance sampling has less noise compared to hemisphere sampling. This
    effect is a result of importance
    sampling sampling the lights directly, whereas hemisphere sampling will sample rays in uniform directions in a
    hemisphere. Since importance sampling takes samples directly from the light sources, there is less randomness in the
    method, and thus less noise.

<h2 style="font-family:verdana,serif" align="middle">Part 5: Adaptive Sampling
</h2>
<p>We edited our raytrace_pixel function to implement adaptive sampling. For each sample, we updated our two variables,
    s1 and s2, that represent the sample's illumination and illumination squared. Then, we calculated the mean and
    standard deviation of the samples so far using the following equations:
</p>

<div align="middle">
    <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="images/part5/Screen Shot 2022-03-16 at 3.22.51 PM.png" align="middle" width="200px"/>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <br>
    </table>
</div>

<p>We then were able to calculate I, a variable that measures the pixel's convergence. If I is small enough (less than
    maxTolerance * mean), we conclude that the pixel has converged and break out of the sampling loop. Next, we updated
    the value we were loading into sampleBuffer.update_pixel by dividing the result of our loop by our updated count
    variable. We also updated the value we were adding into our sampleCountBuffer to be this new count variable.

    <img src="images/part5/bunnyrubyruby_rate.png" align="middle" width="300px"/>
</center>

<p>
    As we can see, our rate image for task 5 has some regions with high sampling rates and some regions with low
    sampling rates. This is somewhat the expected behavior, but we should really be seeing middle sampling rates as well
    (green in the rate image). We have a bug in our part 4 that we were not able to solve in time. This resulted in more
    noise in our image and rays bouncing less than expected. In order to get the desired behavior, we would need our
    rays to terminate farther in the future. We can tell this is the case because of how dark the bunny's shadow is
    under its nose.
</p>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana,serif" align="middle">Conclusion
</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana,serif">Ruby completed part 1 and Jen took the lead in part 2. We walked through our
    implementations and debugged together.
    We worked on part 3 and 4 together. Ruby worked on part 5 when Jen started rendering the images for part 4 on the
    writeup. Ruby created the website and Jen wrote the overview. We split up the writeup pretty evenly depending on
    what parts we worked on. This project felt bigger than the last ones but it was really interesting. We ran into bugs
    on every part, but were usually able to solve them in under a day. I enjoyed rendering illumination and felt like I
    learned a better understanding of rays and bsdf.
